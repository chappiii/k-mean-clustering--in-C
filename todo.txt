Your implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm in C appears to be well-structured and functional. However, there are a few areas where improvements can be made, and some potential issues to consider.

Potential Issues and Improvements:

3. Prevent Infinite Loop in Centroid Initialization:
In the selectRandomCentroids() function, the logic prevents duplicate centroids by checking the selected array, which is good. However, in rare cases (such as when rows == k), it might end up in an infinite loop if all centroids have been selected and it continues trying to select new ones.
You might want to include an additional check or simply handle cases where rows <= k more explicitly:

c
Copy code
if (rows < k) {
    printf("Error: The number of clusters cannot exceed the number of data points.\n");
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
4. Avoid Hard-Coded Tolerance:
You have hardcoded the tolerance value to 0.0001. It would be good to make this configurable by allowing the user to input a tolerance value during runtime.
For example:

c
Copy code
printf("Enter tolerance (default 0.0001): ");
scanf("%lf", &tolerance);
5. Cluster Sizes Memory Management:
When calling assignClusters(), you return the clusterSizes dynamically allocated using calloc. You are currently freeing it inside the freeClusters() function, but you should ensure that memory management is consistent across the entire program.
After calling kmeansClustering(), ensure that clusterSizes is freed if it's not part of the freeClusters().

6. Improve Convergence Condition:
The convergence condition in hasConverged() checks if the centroids have changed by more than a given tolerance. It compares each centroid dimension one by one. This is fine for small datasets, but you could optimize the check by computing a global centroid shift (e.g., by summing the squared differences) and only then checking against the tolerance. This would help in cases where centroids move slightly in many dimensions but might still indicate convergence.
Here is an example of calculating the overall shift:

c
Copy code
double totalShift = 0.0;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
        totalShift += pow(newCentroids[i][j] - oldCentroids[i][j], 2);
    }
}
return (totalShift <= tolerance * tolerance);  // Compare squared values for efficiency

9. Performance Optimization:
In the loop where you're calculating distances between data points and centroids, you're recalculating the entire Euclidean distance for each comparison. For large datasets, this can become a bottleneck. One possible optimization is to store precomputed values or optimize distance calculations based on certain assumptions (e.g., skipping computation if the distance is already greater than the minimum found so far).
10. Code Readability and Modularization:
You have done a good job breaking down the code into several functions. However, some functions like kmeansClustering could be split further for readability. For example, you could separate the process of updating centroids into a different function to make it easier to follow.
Summary:
Add memory allocation error checks.
Ensure proper memory cleanup and free all allocated memory.
Improve user input validation and make parameters like tolerance user-configurable.
Optimize convergence checks and centroid selection to handle edge cases better.
Modularize the code further if needed for better readability and scalability.
With these improvements, your K-means implementation in C will become more robust, reliable, and scalable for a variety of use cases.
